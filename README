readLEDMapping.py is a simple python script to read out LED information from the led_mapping.json file. It can read out the configuration of different LED channels for different mPMT slot or card ids

led_mapping.json is made by modulo using the makeMappingJson.py script. This would need to be re-run if either the mPMT slots in the detector or mapping of the LEDs is updated in modulo
